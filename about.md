      My name is Sherry. I'm a lifelong learner who enjoys taking a hands-on approach to problem solving. I find it rewarding to troubleshoot issues, understand how things work, and share that knowledge with others. Solving problems feels like piecing together a puzzle. It keeps me engaged, curious, and always learning.

      I spent eight years on active duty in the United States Marine Corps. That time helped shaped the way I view situations and work. I learned to adapt in unpredictable situations, stay resilient through challenges, and value the people around me. It taught me that everyone has something they’re good at. No matter who you are, you have something meaningful to contribute.

      After leaving the military, I earned my private pilot license with an instrument rating. That was one of the challenging things I've done. It pushed me far outside my comfort zone and forced me to work through fear and uncertainty. Flying helped me learn to think clearly under pressure and to prepare for whatever might come my way. My first solo flight is still one of my proudest accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm finishing my degree in Computer Science while working at an electric vehicle company. I spend most of my time diagnosing rare and complex battery issues. I genuinely enjoy diving into tough problems, figuring out what’s going wrong, and finding a way forward. It's a challenge, but one my brain gets excited about.
    </p>
    <p>
    I care about how technology is used and understood. I'm especially interested in the ethics of artificial intelligence and how we can make complex systems more transparent and approachable. I'm currently building tools that help people explore and understand information in ways that feel intuitive and empowering. Whether I’m writing code, troubleshooting an issue, organizing my space, or figuring out how to explain something clearly, I approach it all with the same mindset. I like when things make sense.

      Thanks for visiting. I hope you ome back to follow along as I continue learning and building.
