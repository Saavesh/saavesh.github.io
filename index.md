Hi and welcome. My name is Sherry and this is where I share weekly updates on what I’m building, learning, and exploring, mostly at the intersection of technology, ethics, and problem-solving.

Right now, I’m especially focused on making AI more understandable and accessible through hands-on projects like ethical dashboards and risk communication tools. You’ll also find personal reflections on my course project updates.

If you’re interested in the person behind the projects, feel free to check out the **About Me** section.

Thanks for stopping by!
