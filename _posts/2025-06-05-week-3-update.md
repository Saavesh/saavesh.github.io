## What I have been working on this past week

Last week I spent more time reviewing the AI Incident Database and getting a better feel for the kind of information it includes. I brainstormed some notes on how I might group or display the incidents later on. I also started experimenting with basic layout ideas for the dashboard but didn’t get too far with the code yet.

## My plan for this week

This week I’m hoping to load a small sample of the data into Streamlit and try displaying it in a table. My goal is to get something simple working so I can start building from there.

## The roadblocks I have been encountering

Just getting started has been the hardest part. I’ve been juggling other deadlines, so I haven’t had much focused time to really get a solid start. I am optimistic next week will have a lot more progress.

## Reflection on the process used last week and my plan to improve the process

I think I need to set smaller goals during the week, even if it’s something like “open the file and scan the columns.” That way I keep making progress, even on busy days.
