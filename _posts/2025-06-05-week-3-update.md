## What did you do last week?

Last week I spent more time reviewing the AI Incident Database and getting a better feel for the kind of information it includes. I brainstormed some notes on how I might group or display the incidents later on. I also started experimenting with basic layout ideas for the dashboard but didn’t get too far with the code yet.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I’m hoping to load a small sample of the data into Streamlit and try displaying it in a table. My goal is to get something simple working so I can start building from there.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

Just getting started has been the hardest part. I’ve been juggling other deadlines, so I haven’t had much focused time to really get a solid start. I am optimistic next week will have a lot more progress.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I think I need to set smaller goals during the week, even if it’s something like “open the file and scan the columns.” That way I keep making progress, even on busy days.
