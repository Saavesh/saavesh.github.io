## What I have been working on this past week

I spent time getting familiar with the course structure and making sure I set up Piazza correctly. Since this is my first time using Canvas alongside Moodle, I reviewed the syllabus and announcements to better understand how everything is organized. I also brainstormed project ideas and explored the AI Incident Database that our instructor shared! I started setting up my GitHub website but haven’t created the repository yet because I want to review everything first.

## My plan for this week

This week, I plan to submit my project proposal and participate more actively on Piazza. I’ll also continue researching my topic and begin outlining the content I want to include on my website.

## The roadblocks I have been encountering

Mostly just adjusting to Canvas and managing my time. It’s been a bit confusing figuring out where to find updates and due dates since I’m more familiar with Moodle.

## Reflection on the process used last week and my plan to improve the process

I realized I need to spread the work out instead of trying to do everything in one sitting. Moving forward, I plan to break the project into smaller tasks I can work on each day so I stay on track and avoid confusion.
