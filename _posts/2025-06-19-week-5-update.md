## What I did last week:

This week I got a basic prototype of my AI ethics dashboard up and running. I installed the tools I needed (like Streamlit and pandas), pulled in a sample from the AI Incident Database, and wrote some quick code to filter it by incident type and organization. I was able to get a simple dashboard intermittently working locally with a basic bar chart and table. It's definitely not where I want it to be because there are a lot of bugs, but it’s a start.

I also cleaned up my virtual environments so I don’t run into version issues later. I realized I had created a lot of virtual environments over time, and it began to get cluttered. I also spent time working on my website by adding the blog section using Jekyll to track my weekly updates and made the layout a little more personal.

## What I plan to do this week:

This week I plan to clean up the dataset and refine how the information is grouped. I want to create a filter menu so users can select sectors or keywords to explore incident patterns. If there’s time, I’d like to experiment with displaying short summaries next to each chart so the dashboard feels more informative, but that may be too ambitious. I also want to continue improving my website and make the layout more consistent across pages.

## What were the roadblocks?

Streamlit is still new to me, so I’ve had to look up how to do even basic things, like customizing layout and handling user input. Also, the incident data is messy in parts, so it’ll take some time to decide which fields to keep and how to make the info useful without overwhelming the viewer. While I was working on my website, getting Jekyll to cooperate with custom styling has been slightly frustrating, but it hasn't been too bad. I’ve been experimenting with themes and CSS, but I’m still figuring it out.

## Reflection on the process I used last week, and how I plan to make the process work better:

Breaking the work into small steps helped again this week, but it can still be challenging to manage the workload at times. I focused on just getting one or two things working each session instead of trying to make it perfect. I also kept a running list of bugs or ideas to return to later, which made it easier to stay on track. Cleaning up my virtual environments early on also helped reduce confusion between projects. I think next week I want to spend a little more time sketching out what I want the dashboard to feel like before adding more features.
