## What I have been working on this past week

Last week I spent time refining the idea for my AI ethics dashboard project. I decided to focus on visualizing real-world AI incidents, using data from the AI Incident Database. I also started outlining what I want the dashboard to include, like charts that break down issues by sector, and short summaries of each case. I watched a few Streamlit tutorials and began getting familiar with how to build a basic layout.

## My plan for this week

This week I plan to explore the data more. I’m going to try downloading a sample or create a small version of the dataset so I can practice loading and filtering it. I want to build a really simple prototype in Streamlit, even if it just shows a basic table or chart. My goal is to get something up and running so I have a foundation to work from.

## The roadblocks I have been encountering

Learning Streamlit has been a bit of a challenge since I haven’t used it recently. *(Edit: I realized I’ve used Streamlit before, but with different datasets and tools, I mixed them up. It started coming back to me while I was reading the documentation)* I’m also figuring out how to work with this type of dataset, so I’m taking extra time to make sure I understand what I’m looking at and how to organize it.

## Reflection on the process used last week and my plan to improve the process

I noticed I make better progress when I break things into smaller pieces. Instead of telling myself to just “work on the project,” I’ve started writing down clear tasks like “install Streamlit” or “create a mock dataset.” That helped me actually get started. I also want to get better at documenting what I’m learning as I go, since it’ll make writing the final content easier later on.
