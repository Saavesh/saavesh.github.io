## What I did last week:
Last week I spent most of my time debugging my dashboard. I ran into a few stubborn issues that kept breaking the chart rendering, and it felt like I was going in circles trying to figure out what was causing it. I was able to isolate one of the main bugs, which had to do with how the data was being filtered before display, but it’s still not totally resolved.

I also worked a little on cleaning up the layout on my website. It’s nothing major, but I tried to make the navigation feel a bit more intuitive and started sketching some ideas for how I want the dashboard to feel once the core functionality is stable.

## What I plan to do this week:
This week I want to focus on fixing the filtering and chart issues first. If that gets resolved, I’ll try to work on adding better labels and maybe get the summary text to display next to each chart. I’m also hoping to revisit the dataset and think through whether I need to restructure how I’m grouping the information.

## The roadblocks I have been encountering

Debugging has been the biggest blocker. I’ve spent a lot of time reading through documentation and Stack Overflow, but I’m still not totally confident in how  handling filtering. Also, juggling this project with other responsibilities made it hard to get a long uninterrupted session in. I'm really looking forward to the break during July 4th week to catch up.

## Reflection on the process used last week and my plan to improve the process

I realized I need to write things down more as I go. I ended up retracing my steps a few times because I forgot what I had already tried. This week I want to keep a short log of what I test and what the result was, just to keep track. I also want to break down the work into smaller pieces again so I don’t feel stuck staring at the same broken chart for hours.
